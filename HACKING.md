# Overview
This project uses:

Atlassian python API to interact with the running instance
Typer to provide front-end for command-line
Toml for config files

# Testing

* pytest as the test suite
* faker for generating the data
* pytest-cov for coverage (runnable through `coverage.sh` in this repo)

The tests are organized by two marks – `online` and `offline`. `offline` tests cover mostly `confluence_poster` internal parameter validation.

`online` tests require a running instance of confluence to be tested against. The settings for those tests should be specified in `local_config.toml` and `local_config_other_user.toml`. Two files are necessary to simulate scenarios when multiple users write to pages and the script alerts about it. At the time of writing the maintainer of this repo has an open-source license from Atlassian, so if you want to test something but are unable to – do feel free to reach out.

Tests use `record_pages` fixture that captures all pages created during the test and destroys them afterwards. It is populated (somewhat unintuitively) through inspect, but this beats repeating the fixture over and over for every test.

# Misc
The documentation is generated by `mkdocs.py` which parses the docs autogenerated by `typer-cli` and renders the Jinja2 template from docs folder.
